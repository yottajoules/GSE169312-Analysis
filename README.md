# GSE169312 Analysis
analysis of GEO dataset GSE169312

The dataset contains RNAseq and ChIP seq data of EED cKO mice cerebellum.

This analysis focuses on gene ontology of differentially expressed genes within this dataset
Some genes were selected and presented using Gviz visualisation to highlight certain consequences of the experiment conducted

## How to get code to work:
1. Head to NCBI GEO and search for GSE169312
2. Get the RAW and Read Counts into a folder named data on this directory
3. Prepare BROADPEAKS for RAW data
